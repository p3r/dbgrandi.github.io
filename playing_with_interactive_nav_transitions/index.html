I found <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/custom-uiviewcontroller-transitions/">other</a> <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-5/view-controller-transitions.html">posts</a> it, which clarified a few things.</p>

<p><a href="http://objectivetoast.com/2014/04/14/interactive-transitions/">Andrew Hershberger</a> wrote a great post that clarified the last point of confusion that I had, namely the relationship between the non-interactive animation and how it became interactive. The key is that you can control both the <code>speed</code> and <code>timeOffset</code> of animations attached to a CALayer, which allows you to scrub forward and backward easily. This seems to be pretty much how the <code>UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition</code> works. For a deeper explanation of controlling animations, read what Johan Sørensen wrote about <a href="http://johansorensen.com/articles/pausing%20and%20controlling%20the%20speed%20of%20Core%20Animation.html">Pausing and controlling the speed of Core Animation</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to implement something akin to the navigation used in both the <a href="http://iphone.artsy.net">Artsy</a> app or the <a href="https://mobile.yahoo.com/newsdigest/">Yahoo News Digest</a> app. If you have never used either, you should. Both are beautifully designed.</p>

<p>While both apps have a similar style for the basic navigation, looking closer I see two obvious differences: the placement of the navigation buttons and the scaling of the background view.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot of Artsy" src="../images/artsy_transition-888072d5.png" /></p>

<p>First, if you look closely at the Artsy nav, the bottom/back view does not just scale down, it also seems to favor scaling towards the top-center of the screen. We can achieve this by moving the <code>anchorPoint</code> for that layer, which will affect any transformations we add to it.</p>

<p>Second, you may notice that the navigation buttons are not part of the viewControllers within the nav controller, but are part of the actual <code>navigationController.view</code>. So the buttons persist even while <code>viewControllers</code> are pushed or popped.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot of Yahoo News Digest" src="../images/yahoo_news_transition-94cba811.png" /></p>

<p>Yahoo has navigation buttons, but they seem to be attached to the individual view controllers instead of attached to the root view of the navigation controller.</p>

<p>Given these two styles, we'll implement the Artsy version. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/dbgrandi/NavTransitions">here's the code</a>.</p>

<p>The only part that deviates from a normal interaction is that the alpha of the navigation button is connected to the gesture recognizer as well as the animator so that it works properly in either non-interactive or interactive mode. This would be a good contender for refactoring.</p>
